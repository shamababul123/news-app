### INGREDIENTS
To make this application, we're going to need to cover the following topics:
 * HTML -> The information represented on the page.
 * CSS --> The style or look of the information.
 * Javacsript -> The programming language needed to add the necessary behavior (or interaction) to the webpage.
 * API -> (Application Programming Interface) - where and how we get the news data.
 * JSON -> The news data.
 * jQuery -> A javascript library that makes web programming a bit easier for us.
